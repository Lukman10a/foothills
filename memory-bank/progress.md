## Current Status
**Phase: Component Architecture Complete**

The site now has a clean, modular structure with:

## Known Issues
- Search form is currently non-functional (UI only)

## Development Notes
- All components are self-contained with their own state
- Carousel automatically cycles through 3 background images every 3 seconds
- Search form uses responsive grid layout
- All styling done with Tailwind CSS utilities
